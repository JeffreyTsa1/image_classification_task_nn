# image_classification_task_nn
Image classification using neural networks. Completed for school. Part 1 is a classical 80s style shallow network, and part 2 is a more modern network. For part 2, I added activation functions, implemented L2 Regularization, changed network depth and width, and used Convolutional Neural Nets to improve performance.
Tried batch normalization but did not include it in my final implementation. 

This project was changed since I took this class but if you're here to copy code pls don't! Thanks to my fellow TAs/instructor for making this awesome assignment.

There are a few ways to run this code. Before you do, make sure you have Python3, Pytorch, Numpy, and any other required libraries installed. Thanks so much!

Trains snake agent, Ricky, for 1000 games and then simulates 10 games for Ricky to play. Takes average score from 10 games. 
python snake_task.py

Play the game yourself using the keyboard 
python snake_task.py --human
